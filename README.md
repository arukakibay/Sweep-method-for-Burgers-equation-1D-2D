# Sweep-method-for-Burgers-equation-1D-2D
We considered one-dimensional Burgers equation, and have solved by sweep method. Our main task was to take right A, B, C, D, also we used forward step for approximation. Second task was an explicit method for a two-dimensional parabolic equation. We needed to take satisfying step sizes of dx and dy.
